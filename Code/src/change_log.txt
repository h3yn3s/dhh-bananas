- Fixed "fucking crap shit layer fuck bullshit crap fucker suck cock pussy!!!" - :)
- Still have to discuss why the power bar has been taken away from the gorilla into its own layer. Where should it belong to, if not the Gorilla?!?!

Changes:
GameController - line 385/386

_model.powerBar.aimingAngle = _model.bananaThrow.aimingAngle; // --> copy-paste self-assign error to _model.powerBar.aimingAngle before 
_model.powerBar.aimingForce = _model.bananaThrow.aimingForce; // --> copy-paste self-assign error to _model.powerBar.aimingForce before 

GameController - 97 
uncommented -> if (_model.powerBar.gorillaIsAiming)
Otherwise the power bar would never be removed

[ebbmo - 11/25 22:36]

[Daniel - 11/25 12:55]
